Stata usage among older economists may just reflect path dependence.
It has a number of shortcomings, such as no proper package management.

\subsubsection{Command-line execution}

For old versions (before Stata 16), a few Stata commands only work in ``interactive'' mode and not when Stata is invoked at the command line.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{graph export}: 
	``ps and eps are available for all versions of Stata; png and tif are available for all versions of Stata except Stata(console) for Unix; pdf is available only for Stata for Windows and Stata for Mac.''
	See \url{https://www.stata.com/manuals13/g-2graphexport.pdf#g-2graphexport}.
	We usually choose eps format.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Temporary files}
Stata loads at most one dataset at a time, 
thus opening a dataset will cause Stata to discard the dataset that is currently in memory.
This constraint may push you to consider saving lots of intermediate output or temporary files to the \texttt{output} folder of your task.
Don't.
Use Stata's \texttt{tempfile} command instead.

Here is a trivial example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Stata]
clear
use "exampw1.dta", clear
tempfile temp1    // create a temporary file
save "`temp1'"      // save memory into the temporary file
use "exampw2.dta", clear
merge 1:1 v001 v002 v003 using "`temp1'" // use the temporary file
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Evaluating inequalities}
In Stata, missing numeric observations take the value of positive infinity.
Thus, when evaluating inequalities, $.>X$ is true for any $X$.
I prefer using the command \texttt{inrange( )} to avoid this issue.
Consider the following two ways of generating a dummy indicating that x1 takes a positive value:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Stata]
gen byte positive1 = 1 if x1>=0
gen byte positive2 = (inrange(x1,0,.)==1)
\end{lstlisting}
The first command will cause positive1 to be true if x1 is non-negative or if x1 is missing.
By contrast, the second command will set positive2 to true only if x1 is non-negative and non-missing.

\subsubsection{fontface}
The Stata command to use Times New Roman in your PNG file is \texttt{graph set svg fontface "Times New Roman"}.
Apparently Stata groups all rasterized image file types into \texttt{svg}.

\subsubsection{Data in memory after an error}

Stata may befuddle you.
If you use the \texttt{preserve} command,
the data in memory after your script returns an error may not be the data that was in memory at the time of the error:
there is a \texttt{restore} operation after the error.

Your \texttt{merge} that fails an \texttt{assert} may not show the observations that caused the assertion to be false:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=stata]
clear 
tempfile tf1
set obs 15
gen id = _n
save `tf1'
keep if inrange(id,1,10)
merge 1:1 id using `tf1', keep(match) assert(master match)
\end{lstlisting}

This fails because the \texttt{assert} is false.
The crappy thing is that it is hard to debug because the ids 11-15 are not in memory, so when you look at the data after it breaks, you only see matches.
It's like it applies the \texttt{keep()} after failing the assert!

\begin{lstlisting}[language=stata]
. tab _merge

                 _merge |      Freq.     Percent        Cum.
------------------------+-----------------------------------
            matched (3) |         10      100.00      100.00
------------------------+-----------------------------------
                  Total |         10      100.00
\end{lstlisting}
