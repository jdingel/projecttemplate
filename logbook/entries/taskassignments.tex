You need a project management tool to assign tasks, impose deadlines, and track progress.
We use issue trackers on GitHub (or GitLab or BitBucket).
(Previously, I used \href{https://asana.com}{Asana}.)
An issue describes what needs to be done, assigns this responsibility to a set of team members,
and facilitates an accompanying discussion.

Email is \href{https://facilethings.com/blog/en/your-email-is-not-a-todo-list}{not a task management tool}.
You might try to use Slack as a project management tool, but I have not enjoyed it.
It is better for free-flowing conversation than keeping a to-do list.

GitHub doesn't support issue-level due dates (GitLab does),
but we use GitHub's milestones and labels to describe priorities and timetables.
You can add checklists and sub-issues within GitHub issues.
GitHub limits the acceptable types of file attachments.

Jonathan loves the GitHub ``Notifications'' tab.
Following those notifications lets him track others' progress and alerts him to comments.
Jonathan recommends 
(1) turning off GitHub email notifications (Jonathan doesn't like email for workflow, though some of his collaborators do)
and 
(2) installing the \href{https://github.com/mobile}{GitHub app} on your smartphone (great way to see research progress while trapped in seminars!).
